Security Engineer @ VTEX

## 🗓️ What I am doing?
- 📰 Creating a blog about cybersecurity (cloud and application security), software engineer, and some topics about human relationships (empathy, personal identity, etc.).
- 📚 I study a lot about computer science, and also love to understand human behavior, my dream is to do a degree in psychology.
- 💃 My hobby is being a multi-artist, if I am not doing something related to a computer, I am probably, acting, dancing, and soon I will be also be playing guitar.
- 🌲 I also love to do body exercises, so you will probably see me on Sundays riding a bike on Avenida Paulista, while I try to take a peak on the urban shows that are happening.
